This is just a little repo that I put together to re-create some of the behavior from [mlynch/nextjs-tailwind-capacitor](https://github.com/mlynch/nextjs-tailwind-capacitor) to play around with tailwind-react-native in a semi-realistic scenario, and also just go through the paces of re-building something simple for the usual learnings.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code.
